Welcome to Day 24 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll learn about Kubernetes Garbage Collection mechanisms for resource management.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Kubernetes Garbage Collection**: Understand the principles of Kubernetes Garbage Collection for efficient resource utilization.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Explore Kubernetes Garbage Collection
- Dive into the [Kubernetes Garbage Collection](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/) documentation to grasp the concept and importance of resource cleanup.
- Learn how Kubernetes automates the removal of unused resources.

### Task 2: Cleanup Strategies
- Explore different cleanup strategies in Kubernetes, including the OrphanDependents and OwnerReferences concepts.
- Understand how these strategies help maintain a clean cluster.

### Task 3: Suggested Project
- Implement a Garbage Collection strategy in your local Kubernetes cluster. Experiment with creating and deleting resources to see the cleanup process in action.
