Welcome to Day 3 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! üöÄ Today, we'll dive deeper into Kubernetes architecture, specifically focusing on node components.

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Node Components**: Gain insights into Kubernetes node components and their roles in the cluster.

## üöÄ Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Node Components
- Explore the [Kubernetes Node Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) documentation to understand the functions of components like Kubelet, Container Runtime, and Kube Proxy.
- Learn how these components collaborate to manage containers on individual nodes.

### Task 2: Node Communication
- Study how nodes communicate with the Control Plane and with each other in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Understand the significance of secure communication between nodes and the Control Plane.

### Task 3: Suggested Project
- Continue with your local Kubernetes cluster from Day 2. Experiment with deploying Pods on different nodes and observe how node components come into play.

## üåê Additional Resources
