Welcome to Day 3 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, we'll dive deeper into Kubernetes architecture, specifically focusing on node components.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Node Components**: Gain insights into Kubernetes node components and their roles in the cluster.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Node Components
- Explore the [Kubernetes Node Components](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/) documentation to understand the functions of components like Kubelet, Container Runtime, and Kube Proxy.
- Learn how these components collaborate to manage containers on individual nodes.

### Task 2: Node Communication
- Study how nodes communicate with the Control Plane and with each other in a Kubernetes cluster.
- Understand the significance of secure communication between nodes and the Control Plane.

### Task 3: Suggested Project
- Continue with your local Kubernetes cluster from Day 2. Experiment with deploying Pods on different nodes and observe how node components come into play.

Understanding Kubernetes architecture, both at the cluster level and node level, is essential for effectively managing containerized applications. Tomorrow, we will explore how to setup Kubernetes cluster on local machine.
