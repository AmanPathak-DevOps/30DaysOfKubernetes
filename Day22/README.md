Welcome to Day 22 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! üöÄ Today, you'll continue your exploration of StatefulSets and learn about DaemonSets, which are used for running a copy of a Pod on every node in the cluster.

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **DaemonSets**: Understand what DaemonSets are and when to use them.
- **Comparing StatefulSets and DaemonSets**: Explore the differences between StatefulSets and DaemonSets.

## üöÄ Let's Get Started

### Task 1: DaemonSets Overview
- Explore the [Kubernetes DaemonSets documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) to understand the role of DaemonSets in Kubernetes.

### Task 2: Deploying DaemonSets
- Create a DaemonSet within your Kubernetes cluster to run a copy of a Pod on every node. Observe its behavior.

### Task 3: StatefulSets vs. DaemonSets
- Compare and contrast the use cases for StatefulSets and DaemonSets. When would you choose one over the other?

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Apply DaemonSets to a scenario in which you need a Pod to run on every node, such as a monitoring agent or a log collector.

## üåê Additional Resources

- [Kubernetes Official Documentation - DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/): Detailed information on DaemonSets.

Understanding StatefulSets and DaemonSets expands your knowledge of managing specific workload types in Kubernetes. Tomorrow, you'll gain hands-on experience with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
