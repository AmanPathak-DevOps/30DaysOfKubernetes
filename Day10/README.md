Welcome to Day 10 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll learn how to set up Kubernetes master and worker nodes on a cloud provider like AWS.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Kubernetes Cluster Setup**: Understand the process of setting up Kubernetes master and worker nodes on a cloud provider.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Cloud Provider Setup
- Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for your Kubernetes cluster.
- Explore the official documentation of your chosen cloud provider for Kubernetes cluster setup.

### Task 2: Kubernetes Installation
- Follow the instructions in the cloud provider's documentation to set up a Kubernetes cluster with both master and worker nodes.

### Task 3: Cluster Verification
- Verify that your Kubernetes cluster is up and running. Ensure that you can interact with it using kubectl.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Deploy a sample application on your cloud-based Kubernetes cluster to practice managing nodes and applications in a cloud environment.
