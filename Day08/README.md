Welcome to Day 08 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll dive into ReplicationSets and Controllers, which play a crucial role in managing replica pods within your Kubernetes cluster.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **ReplicationSets**: Understand what ReplicationSets are and how they ensure a specified number of pod replicas are running.
- **Controllers**: Explore the concept of controllers in Kubernetes and their role in maintaining desired pod states.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: ReplicationSets
- Dive into the [Kubernetes ReplicationSets documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) to learn about the features and use cases of ReplicationSets.

### Task 2: Creating ReplicationSets
- Create a ReplicationSet for one of your existing pods or a new application. Observe how it manages the specified number of pod replicas.

### Task 3: Controllers
- Explore other types of controllers in Kubernetes, such as Deployments and StatefulSets. Understand their differences and when to use each.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Create a simple application with multiple pod replicas managed by a ReplicationSet. Experiment with scaling up and down to observe how it works.
