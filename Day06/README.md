Welcome to Day 6 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, we'll explore Kubernetes Jobs for batch task management.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Kubernetes Jobs**: Understand the concept of Kubernetes Jobs for running batch tasks in a cluster.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Kubernetes Jobs
- Dive into the [Kubernetes Jobs documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/) to grasp the concept and usage of Jobs.
- Learn how to create and manage Jobs in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Task 2: Running Batch Tasks
- Experiment with running batch tasks using Kubernetes Jobs in your local cluster.
- Observe how Jobs ensure the successful completion of tasks.

### Task 3: Suggested Project
- Create a simple batch task using Kubernetes Jobs. You can simulate tasks like data processing or batch computations.

## 🌐 Additional Resources
