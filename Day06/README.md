Welcome to Day 6 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, it's time to put your knowledge into practice by deploying your first application on Kubernetes.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Application Deployment**: Gain hands-on experience in deploying applications on a Kubernetes cluster.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Choose an Application
- Select a simple application or service that you want to deploy on Kubernetes. It could be a web app, a database, or any other containerized application.

### Task 2: Create Deployment YAML
- Write a Kubernetes Deployment YAML file to define how your application should be deployed. Specify the container image, ports, and any necessary environment variables.

### Task 3: Deploy Your Application
- Use `kubectl` to deploy your application to your Kubernetes cluster. Observe the deployment process and ensure it runs successfully.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Create a basic web application (e.g., a Hello World web server) and deploy it on Kubernetes. You can later build upon this project for more complex applications.

Deploying your first application is an exciting step in your Kubernetes journey. Tomorrow, we'll explore the use of labels and selectors.
