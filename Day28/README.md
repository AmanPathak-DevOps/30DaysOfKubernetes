Welcome to Day 28 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! üöÄ Today, you'll explore Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Microsoft's managed Kubernetes service in Azure, and its key features.

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Azure AKS**: Understand what Azure AKS is and its benefits.
- **Features**: Explore the features of Azure AKS for deploying and managing Kubernetes clusters.

## üöÄ Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Azure AKS Overview
- Visit the [Azure AKS documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) to learn about Azure AKS and its offerings.

### Task 2: Setting Up Azure AKS
- Follow the Azure documentation to set up an Azure AKS cluster. Deploy a sample application if available.

### Task 3: Exploring Azure AKS Features
- Dive into the features of Azure AKS, including auto-scaling, managed node pools, and integration with Azure services.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Deploy one of your applications or projects on Azure AKS to gain hands-on experience with this managed Kubernetes service.

## üåê Additional Resources

- [Azure AKS Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/): Detailed information on Azure AKS.
- [Deploy Application on AKS](https://youtu.be/Q0Jqy3Jp65c?si=FmdJA9BWA9vLsWfl)

Exploring Azure AKS is a valuable step in your Kubernetes journey. Tomorrow, we'll discover Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google Cloud's managed Kubernetes service.
