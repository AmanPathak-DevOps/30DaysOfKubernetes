Welcome to Day 20 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll explore tools and techniques for managing multiple Kubernetes clusters efficiently.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Multi-Cluster Strategy**: Understand the importance of multi-cluster strategies in Kubernetes.
- **Tools**: Explore tools and techniques for managing and orchestrating multiple Kubernetes clusters.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Multi-Cluster Strategies
- Learn about the benefits and use cases of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters. Explore strategies like multi-region and multi-cloud deployments.

### Task 2: Kubernetes Federation
- Dive into Kubernetes Federation and understand how it helps manage multiple clusters as a single entity.

### Task 3: Kubectl Contexts
- Explore the use of `kubectl` contexts to switch between and manage different Kubernetes clusters.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Set up multiple Kubernetes clusters in different regions or cloud providers and experiment with managing them using `kubectl` contexts.
