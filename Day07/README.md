Welcome to Day 07 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll learn about the importance of labels and selectors in Kubernetes for resource categorization and selection.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Labels and Selectors**: Understand how to use labels to categorize resources and selectors to filter resources based on labels.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Label Your Resources
- Select a set of resources in your Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Pods, Services, Deployments) and label them with meaningful key-value pairs.

### Task 2: Select Resources with Label Selectors
- Use label selectors to filter and query resources with specific labels. Practice different label selector options.

### Task 3: Demonstrate Label-Based Resource Management
- Create scenarios where labels and selectors would be useful in resource management, such as routing traffic or applying policies.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Design and implement a labeling strategy for your Kubernetes applications to improve resource management and organization.
