Welcome to Day 5 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll understand kubeconfig files and learn to write YAML files for deploying applications and services.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **kubeconfig Files**: Learn about kubeconfig files and their role in Kubernetes configuration.
- **YAML for Deployment**: Explore YAML files for deploying applications and services in Kubernetes.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: kubeconfig Files
- Explore the [Kubernetes Configuration Files](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) documentation to understand the structure and usage of kubeconfig files.
- Learn how to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters using kubeconfig.

### Task 2: Writing YAML for Deployment
- Dive into the [Kubernetes YAML](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/deployment-v1/) documentation to create YAML files for deploying applications using Deployments.
- Understand how to define services with YAML for service discovery.

### Task 3: Suggested Project
- Create a kubeconfig file for your local cluster (Minikube or kind) and use it to deploy a simple application using YAML files. Experiment with different deployment strategies.
