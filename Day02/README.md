Welcome to Day 2 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll explore the foundational aspects of Kubernetes architecture and its core components.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Kubernetes Architecture**: Understand the high-level architecture of Kubernetes and how it manages containerized applications.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Explore Kubernetes Architecture
- Dive into the [Kubernetes Architecture Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/) in the official documentation.
- Familiarize yourself with the key components of Kubernetes, including the Control Plane and Node components.

### Task 2: Core Components
- Get to know essential Kubernetes components like the API Server, etcd, and Controller Manager.
- Understand the role of these components in maintaining the desired state of your cluster.
