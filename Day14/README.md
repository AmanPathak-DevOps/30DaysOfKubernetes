Welcome to Day 14 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! üöÄ Today, you'll explore ConfigMaps and Secrets, two valuable resources for managing configuration data and sensitive information in Kubernetes.

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **ConfigMaps**: Understand how to use ConfigMaps to store and manage configuration data.
- **Secrets**: Learn how to work with Kubernetes Secrets to securely handle sensitive information.

## üöÄ Let's Get Started

### Task 1: ConfigMaps
- Dive into the [Kubernetes ConfigMaps documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/) to grasp the concept and usage of ConfigMaps.

### Task 2: Creating ConfigMaps
- Create a ConfigMap containing configuration data for one of your applications. Use it within a pod to access the configuration.

### Task 3: Secrets
- Explore [Kubernetes Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) and learn how to store and access sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys.

### Task 4: Using Secrets
- Implement a Secret in your Kubernetes cluster, and modify your application to read sensitive data from it securely.

### Task 5: Suggested Project
- Enhance your existing applications by separating configuration data and sensitive information into ConfigMaps and Secrets, respectively.

## üåê Additional Resources

- [Kubernetes Official Documentation - ConfigMaps](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/): Detailed information on ConfigMaps.
- [Kubernetes Official Documentation - Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/): Detailed information on Secrets.
