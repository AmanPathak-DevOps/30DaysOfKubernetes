Welcome to Day 11 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll explore Kubernetes Services, a fundamental concept for load balancing and service discovery within your cluster.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Kubernetes Services**: Understand different types of Kubernetes Services, including ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
- **Service Discovery**: Learn how Kubernetes Services facilitate service discovery among pods.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Kubernetes Services
- Dive into the [Kubernetes Services documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) to grasp the concept and usage of Services.

### Task 2: Creating Services
- Create different types of Kubernetes Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) to expose your applications and observe their behavior.

### Task 3: Service Discovery
- Explore how pods within your cluster can discover and communicate with services using DNS.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Enhance one of your applications by setting up a Kubernetes Service to enable load balancing and service discovery.
