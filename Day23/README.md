Welcome to Day 23 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! üöÄ Today, you'll get hands-on experience with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS), Amazon's managed Kubernetes service.

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Amazon EKS**: Gain an understanding of Amazon EKS and its key features.
- **Practical Experience**: Set up and explore Amazon EKS to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters.

## üöÄ Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Amazon EKS Overview
- Read about [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) to understand its offerings and benefits.

### Task 2: Setting Up Amazon EKS
- Follow Amazon's documentation to set up an Amazon EKS cluster. Deploy a sample application if possible.

### Task 3: Exploring EKS Features
- Explore the features of Amazon EKS, such as automatic scaling, managed node groups, and integration with other AWS services.

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Deploy one of your applications or projects on Amazon EKS to gain hands-on experience with this managed Kubernetes service.

## üåê Additional Resources

- [Amazon EKS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html): Comprehensive information on Amazon EKS.
- [Kubernetes- Deploy Application on AWS EKS](https://youtu.be/RRCrY12VY_s?si=l5l9uozkInyGjrWK)

Exploring Amazon EKS provides valuable insights into using Kubernetes on AWS. Tomorrow, we'll continue our journey by exploring Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
