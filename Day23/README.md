Welcome to Day 23 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll continue your exploration of StatefulSets and learn about DaemonSets, which are used for running a copy of a Pod on every node in the cluster.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **DaemonSets**: Understand what DaemonSets are and when to use them.
- **Comparing StatefulSets and DaemonSets**: Explore the differences between StatefulSets and DaemonSets.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: DaemonSets Overview
- Explore the [Kubernetes DaemonSets documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) to understand the role of DaemonSets in Kubernetes.

### Task 2: Deploying DaemonSets
- Create a DaemonSet within your Kubernetes cluster to run a copy of a Pod on every node. Observe its behavior.

### Task 3: StatefulSets vs. DaemonSets
- Compare and contrast the use cases for StatefulSets and DaemonSets. When would you choose one over the other?

### Task 4: Suggested Project
- Apply DaemonSets to a scenario in which you need a Pod to run on every node, such as a monitoring agent or a log collector.
