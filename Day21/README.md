Welcome to Day 21 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! üöÄ Today, you'll dive into Ingress and Network Policies, essential components for managing external access to services and controlling network traffic within your Kubernetes cluster.

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Ingress Controllers**: Understand Ingress controllers and how they enable external access to services.
- **Network Policies**: Learn about Network Policies and their role in securing and controlling network traffic.

## üöÄ Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Ingress Controllers
- Explore the [Kubernetes Ingress documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to understand Ingress controllers and how to set them up.

### Task 2: Setting Up Ingress
- Create an Ingress resource for one of your services to allow external access. Test and verify the setup.

### Task 3: Network Policies
- Dive into [Kubernetes Network Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) and learn how to define policies to control traffic between pods.

### Task 4: Implementing Network Policies
- Create a Network Policy that restricts network traffic between selected pods in your cluster.

### Task 5: Suggested Project
- Enhance the security of one of your applications by implementing Network Policies to control incoming and outgoing traffic.
