Welcome to Day 21 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! üöÄ Today, you'll dive into Ingress essential components for managing external access to services outside of the Cluster.

## üìã Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Ingress Controllers**: Understand Ingress controllers and how they enable external access to services.

## üöÄ Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Ingress Controllers
- Explore the [Kubernetes Ingress documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) to understand Ingress controllers and how to set them up.

### Task 2: Setting Up Ingress
- Create an Ingress resource for one of your services to allow external access. Test and verify the setup.

### Task 3: Suggested Project
- Perform HostBased, PathBased Routing and try to add TLS/SSL certificate to the domain.

## üåê Additional Resources

- [Kubernetes Official Documentation - Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/): Detailed information on Kubernetes Ingress.
- [Kubernetes- Ingress](https://youtu.be/GhZi4DxaxxE?si=sDuGK70lmJWMNyaQ)

Understanding Ingress and Network Policies is crucial for managing external access and securing your Kubernetes cluster. Tomorrow, we'll dive into advanced concepts with StatefulSets.
