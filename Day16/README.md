Welcome to Day 16 of the Kubernetes 30-Day Learning Challenge! 🚀 Today, you'll understand the role of Init Containers in preparing application containers.

## 📋 Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will:
- **Init Containers**: Learn about Init Containers and their significance in containerized applications.

## 🚀 Let's Get Started

### Task 1: Init Containers
- Explore the [Kubernetes Init Containers documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/) to understand what Init Containers are and how they work.
- Learn how to define and use Init Containers in a Pod specification.

### Task 2: Use Cases
- Study real-world use cases for Init Containers. These include preparing application configuration, setting up databases, or downloading necessary files before the main application starts.

### Task 3: Suggested Project
- Implement an Init Container in a Kubernetes Pod. Create a scenario where an Init Container sets up environment variables for the main application.
